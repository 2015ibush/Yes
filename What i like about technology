Technology is a pivital part of modern society. What interests me about technology is that it is ever changing and always progressing. This simple concept can be seen if you do something as simple as look at a phone or computer from just a couple years agox you will see that those phones/computers that are only a few years old, you will see that they are simply inferior to the newest technology
